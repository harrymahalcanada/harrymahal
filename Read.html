                             Neoliberal policies contribute to rising crime rates and deepening social inequalities in urban communities by: 
 <br>
•	Intensifying Economic Disparities: While neoliberalism has advantages and benefits, it also disadvantages people making the rich to become richer and the poor to become poorer. It encourages consumerism and proliferation of commodified goods and services, and thus constantly drives the people to consume, thus reinforcing these inequalities. Mineral dependent communities, especially women and POCs are affected more as they must deal with amplified economic and social injustice. 
 <br>
•	Reducing Public Services: Neoliberal policies are usually characterised by a decrease in expenditure on social services, which are the social safety nets that are critical in addressing the causes of criminal related activities. This reduces the self-defence mechanisms in societies thus increasing the community's vulnerability to suspects hence, a high probability of committing crime as a survival tactic on poor communities thus making them more vulnerable and more likely to engage in criminal activities as a way of surviving. Privatization of people stretching even to services continues to offload the safety and security role assumed by people as they are expected to buy protection and thus relieve the state. 
 <br>
•	Promoting Punitive Crime Control Measures: They find neoliberalism crews plaintive crime control measures as a way through which order is maintained in societies where inequalities are on the rise. This involves the extension of the political capacity of imprisonment or the carceral state and the elements of tough policing and sentencing. Because of this emphasis that arrests and incarcerations are more suitable than punitive ones, and neglect programs that are reformative or preventive, social disparities are aggravated, specifically affecting minority groups. The carceral state and the role that it plays is to control or contain populations that are considered problematic, and crime becomes the Result of poverty and disadvantage is punished.
