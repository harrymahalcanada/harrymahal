                             1. What specific neoliberal policies most significantly impact economic disparities in urban areas? 
 <br>
Some of the neoliberal measures that affect the body of relative income inequalities within urban settings include Deregulation, A biased tax code in favor of the wealthy, and the cashing in of public utilities. One way in which deregulation is commonly practiced is through rolling back regulations that protect workers’ rights, wages, or benefits – a decision that primarily impacts poor people. They opined that tax cuts like the lowering of corporate or higher-end income taxes are a major cause of income inequality because they increase the potential for highly concentrated wealth while accounting for less public revenue. Some of the mentioned elements include privatization of services such as health, education, and transport. 
 <br>
 2. How does the reduction of public services under neoliberalism affect community relations and crime rates? 
 <br>
This autonomic system of government under neoliberalism can cause a deterioration of the relations between the people and the government and a rise in the rates of crime. Some of the basic government services including education, health, housing, as well as social assistance facilities play an important role in ensuring that the citizens have a basic standard of living that can be catered for by the state. When these services are removed or privatised it means that those unable to pay for the better forms the end up even further marginalized, sink deep into poverty and social exclusion. Such conditions lead to increased stress, desperation, and dilution of social compact among the populace who end up being captives of their circumstances. As such, crime levels may increase since people may resort to criminal deeds in their attempt to achieve their basic needs, or criminality may escalate since people lose their sense of morality and hence cannot be relied upon to observe the law or report unlawful acts. 
 <br>
 3. In what ways do neoliberal punitive crime control measures contribute to social inequalities in urban communities? 
 <br>
New Rightist and neo-positivist crime fighting strategies, include stricter law enforcement, long-term imprisonment, and the enlargement of the carceral state, weigh on social injustice because they target vulnerable populations. Many of these policies are revamped to address crime through punitive measures and less emphasis on rehabilitation with a clear and noticeable implication of incarcerating more poor groups and people of color. This is further compounded as some police officers engage in racially profiling and subsequent harsher policing of the black community. After being ensnared in the criminal justice system, there are many hurdles to reintegration, among them difficulties in finding a job, limitations placed on where one can live or to whom one can apply for housing, and the stigma of criminal records. This leads to the poor being incarcerated and left in that state, making the poor more marginalized and making social mobility in the urban areas almost impossible
